Thank you for buying the Space Game Starter Kit!

please don't hesitate to email support@tasharen.com or PM 'ArenMook' on the Unity forums.

****** !!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!! ******
------------------------------------

Since Unity project settings don't seem to get included in the package, YOU WILL GET ERRORS related to input!
To fix them, you will need to unzip the contents of ProjectSettings.zip into the ProjectSettings folder,
overwriting its contents. After that everything should be fine. :)

--------------------------
Adding NGUI to the project
--------------------------

Please *DO NOT* import NGUI's package. Instead, import NGUI into a brand-new project,
then COPY NGUI's "Scripts" and "Resources" folders into SGSK. If you import NGUI directly,
Unity will take the liberty of replacing some of SGSK's files with NGUI's, which will
result in a BROKEN PROJECT. Copying files instead works fine.

------------------------------------------
As advertised, the kit's features include:
------------------------------------------

- Multiplayer support out of the box
- Controllable with keyboard/mouse as well as the XBox 360 controller
- Simple yet powerful UI system (no need for any additional UI package; optimized for Android/iOS)
- Planet shader lets you create your own unique looking planets with a few clicks of a mouse
- Fully tweakable ship parameters -- create anything from a slow, unwieldy cargo ship to a fast highly manuverable assault fighter
- Asteroid shader automatically seamlessly textures rocks of all shapes and sizes (no UVs required!)
- Real-time dynamic reflections on anything you like via a simple attachable script (Pro only)
- Localized gravity example (space station)
- Distortion shield effect
- Control impairment on collision
- Near miss detection
- 3D HUD (no OnGUI used!)
- Simple targeting indicators
- Even runs on Android and iOS (with appropriately limited functionality)

All of that in clean, easy to understand and well-optimized code.
